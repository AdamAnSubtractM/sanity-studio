/**
 * Generated TypeScript types and GROQ queries for the portfolio Sanity studio.
 *
 * This package is the contract between the studio that owns the schema and the
 * Astro site that consumes it. Each query exported here is paired with a
 * `*_RESULT` type generated from the studio's schema by `sanity typegen` —
 * pass the query to a Sanity client and annotate the fetch with the matching
 * result type to get fully-typed responses.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createClient } from '@sanity/client';
 * import {
 *   RESUME_QUERY,
 *   type RESUME_QUERY_RESULT
 * } from '@adam/portfolio-sanity';
 *
 * const client = createClient({ projectId: '…', dataset: 'production', apiVersion: '2024-11-16' });
 * const resume = await client.fetch<RESUME_QUERY_RESULT>(RESUME_QUERY, { slug: 'portfolio' });
 * ```
 *
 * @module
